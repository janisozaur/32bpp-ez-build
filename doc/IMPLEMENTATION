 \-->base               builds the 'base' sprites (i.e. 32bpp replacements 
 |    |                 for ogfx1_base in OpenGFX or equivalent in another baseset)
 |    |
 |    \-->sprites       contains the 32bpp sprites named <sprite_id>.png (ZOOM_LEVEL_NORMAL),
 |                      <sprite_id>_z1.png (ZOOM_LEVEL_IN_X2) or <sprite_id>_z0.png
 |                      (ZOOM_LEVEL_IN_X4), and corresponding mask files (named
 |                      <sprite_id>m.png, <sprite_id>_z1m.png or <sprite_id>_z0m.png

 \-->arctic             builds the 'arctic' override sprites (i.e. 32bpp replacements
 |    |                 for ogfxc_arctic in OpenGFX or equivalent in another baseset)
 |    |
 |    \-->sprites       contains the 32bpp sprites named <sprite_id>.png (ZOOM_LEVEL_NORMAL),
 |                      <sprite_id>_z1.png (ZOOM_LEVEL_IN_X2) or <sprite_id>_z0.png

 |                      WARNING!!! The sprite ids used are the ACTUALLY OVERRIDEN sprite
 |                      id, and not the remapped baseset sprite ids which are typically
 |                      used by basesets (such as OpenGFX or zBase).
 | 
 |                      As a corallary, you can actually override ANY srpite id from 
 |                      base in the arctic climate, even if traditionally (i.e. in 
 |                      original_windows or OpenGFX) it wasn't actually overriden.
 |
 \-->tropical           builds the 'tropical' override sprites (i.e. 32bpp replacements
 |    |                 for ogfxh_tropical in OpenGFX or equivalent in another baseset)
 |    |
 |    \-->sprites       contains the 32bpp sprites named <sprite_id>.png (ZOOM_LEVEL_NORMAL),
 |                      <sprite_id>_z1.png (ZOOM_LEVEL_IN_X2) or <sprite_id>_z0.png      
 |                      (ZOOM_LEVEL_IN_X4), and corresponding mask files (named
 |                      <sprite_id>m.png, <sprite_id>_z1m.png or <sprite_id>_z0m.png.

 |                      WARNING!!! The sprite ids used are the ACTUALLY OVERRIDEN sprite 
 |                      id, and not the remapped baseset sprite ids which are typically

 \-->extra              builds the 'extra' sprites (i.e. 32bpp replacements for
      |                 ogfxe_extra in OpenGFX or equivalent in another baseset).
      |
      \-->sprites       Contains the 32bpp sprites. Only the (ZOOM_LEVEL_IN_X4) zoom level
                        is used currently, expected in files ending in '_z0.png'. Corresponding
			masks are expected in the corresponding '_z0m.png' file.

			The graphic files are stored in a sub-hierarchy inside this sprites
			folder, and the actual names of the files are irrelevant. However
			their alphbetical ORDER is important!

			the extra/build_nml.extra shell script explicitly lists each subfolder
			to be included, and assigns it to a specific block of 'extra' sprites
			using the corresponding NewGRF API function. Therefore the ordering
			of the sprites of a particular block inside its subfolder is important.


It is perfectly possible to play around yourself by adding or removing new sprires inside the various 
folders and rerunning:

	make clean ; make

to rebuild a new 32bpp_ez.grf file with your custom set of sprites.
